# Frontend Slides

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — Generate visual previews, not abstract choices. People discover what they want by seeing it.
3. **Distinctive Design** — No generic "AI slop." Every presentation must feel custom-crafted.
4. **Viewport Fitting (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within 100vh. No scrolling within slides, ever. Content overflows? Split into multiple slides.

## Design Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:

- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.

## Viewport Fitting Rules

These invariants apply to EVERY slide in EVERY presentation:

- Every `.slide` must have `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden;`
- ALL font sizes and spacing must use `clamp(min, preferred, max)` — never fixed px/rem
- Content containers need `max-height` constraints
- Images: `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`
- Breakpoints required for heights: 700px, 600px, 500px
- Include `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Never negate CSS functions directly (`-clamp()`, `-min()`, `-max()` are silently ignored) — use `calc(-1 * clamp(...))` instead

**When generating, read `viewport-base.css` and include its full contents in every presentation.**

### Content Density Limits Per Slide

| Slide Type    | Maximum Content                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title slide   | 1 heading + 1 subtitle + optional tagline                 |
| Content slide | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points OR 1 heading + 2 paragraphs |
| Feature grid  | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum (2x3 or 3x2)                  |
| Code slide    | 1 heading + 8-10 lines of code                            |
| Quote slide   | 1 quote (max 3 lines) + attribution                       |
| Image slide   | 1 heading + 1 image (max 60vh height)                     |

**Content exceeds limits? Split into multiple slides. Never cram, never scroll.**

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

Determine what the user wants:

- **Mode A: New Presentation** — Create from scratch. Go to Phase 1.
- **Mode B: PPT Conversion** — Convert a .pptx file. Go to Phase 4.
- **Mode C: Enhancement** — Improve an existing HTML presentation. Read it, understand it, enhance. **Follow Mode C modification rules below.**

### Mode C: Modification Rules

When enhancing existing presentations, viewport fitting is the biggest risk:

1. **Before adding content:** Count existing elements, check against density limits
2. **Adding images:** Must have `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`. If slide already has max content, split into two slides
3. **Adding text:** Max 4-6 bullets per slide. Exceeds limits? Split into continuation slides
4. **After ANY modification, verify:** `.slide` has `overflow: hidden`, new elements use `clamp()`, images have viewport-relative max-height, content fits at 1280x720
5. **Proactively reorganize:** If modifications will cause overflow, automatically split content and inform the user. Don't wait to be asked

**When adding images to existing slides:** Move image to new slide or reduce other content first. Never add images without checking if existing content already fills the viewport.

## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)

**Ask ALL questions in a single AskUserQuestion call** so the user fills everything out at once:

**Question 1 — Purpose** (header: "Purpose"):
What is this presentation for? Options: Pitch deck / Teaching-Tutorial / Conference talk / Internal presentation

**Question 2 — Length** (header: "Length"):
Approximately how many slides? Options: Short 5-10 / Medium 10-20 / Long 20+

**Question 3 — Content** (header: "Content"):
Do you have content ready? Options: All content ready / Rough notes / Topic only

**Question 4 — Inline Editing** (header: "Editing"):
Do you need to edit text directly in the browser after generation? Options:

- "Yes (Recommended)" — Can edit text in-browser, auto-save to localStorage, export file
- "No" — Presentation only, keeps file smaller

**Remember the user's editing choice — it determines whether edit-related code is included in Phase 3.**

If user has content, ask them to share it.

### Step 1.2: Image Evaluation (if images provided)

If user selected "No images" → skip to Phase 2.

If user provides an image folder:

1. **Scan** — List all image files (.png, .jpg, .svg, .webp, etc.)
2. **View each image** — Use the Read tool (Claude is multimodal)
3. **Evaluate** — For each: what it shows, USABLE or NOT USABLE (with reason), what concept it represents, dominant colors
4. **Co-design the outline** — Curated images inform slide structure alongside text. This is NOT "plan slides then add images" — design around both from the start (e.g., 3 screenshots → 3 feature slides, 1 logo → title/closing slide)
5. **Confirm via AskUserQuestion** (header: "Outline"): "Does this slide outline and image selection look right?" Options: Looks good / Adjust images / Adjust outline

**Logo in previews:** If a usable logo was identified, embed it (base64) into each style preview in Phase 2 — the user sees their brand styled three different ways.

---

## Phase 2: Style Discovery

**This is the "show, don't tell" phase.** Most people can't articulate design preferences in words.

### Step 2.0: Style Path

Ask how they want to choose (header: "Style"):

- "Show me options" (recommended) — Generate 3 previews based on mood
- "I know what I want" — Pick from preset list directly

**If direct selection:** Show preset picker and skip to Phase 3. Available presets are defined in [STYLE_PRESETS.md](STYLE_PRESETS.md).

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

Ask (header: "Vibe", multiSelect: true, max 2):
What feeling should the audience have? Options:

- Impressed/Confident — Professional, trustworthy
- Excited/Energized — Innovative, bold
- Calm/Focused — Clear, thoughtful
- Inspired/Moved — Emotional, memorable

### Step 2.2: Generate 3 Style Previews

Based on mood, generate 3 distinct single-slide HTML previews showing typography, colors, animation, and overall aesthetic. Read [STYLE_PRESETS.md](STYLE_PRESETS.md) for available presets and their specifications.

| Mood                | Suggested Presets                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Impressed/Confident | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Dark Botanical       |
| Excited/Energized   | Creative Voltage, Neon Cyber, Split Pastel         |
| Calm/Focused        | Notebook Tabs, Paper & Ink, Swiss Modern           |
| Inspired/Moved      | Dark Botanical, Vintage Editorial, Pastel Geometry |

Save previews to `.claude-design/slide-previews/` (style-a.html, style-b.html, style-c.html). Each should be self-contained, ~50-100 lines, showing one animated title slide.

Open each preview automatically for the user.

### Step 2.3: User Picks

Ask (header: "Style"):
Which style preview do you prefer? Options: Style A: [Name] / Style B: [Name] / Style C: [Name] / Mix elements

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.

## Phase 3: Generate Presentation

Generate the full presentation using content from Phase 1 (text, or text + curated images) and style from Phase 2.

If images were provided, the slide outline already incorporates them from Step 1.2. If not, CSS-generated visuals (gradients, shapes, patterns) provide visual interest — this is a fully supported first-class path.

**Before generating, read these supporting files:**

- [html-template.md](html-template.md) — HTML architecture and JS features
- [viewport-base.css](viewport-base.css) — Mandatory CSS (include in full)
- [animation-patterns.md](animation-patterns.md) — Animation reference for the chosen feeling

**Key requirements:**

- Single self-contained HTML file, all CSS/JS inline
- Include the FULL contents of viewport-base.css in the `<style>` block
- Use fonts from Fontshare or Google Fonts — never system fonts
- Add detailed comments explaining each section
- Every section needs a clear `/* === SECTION NAME === */` comment block

**To save the output**, use `write_file` to save the complete HTML to the output folder:
```
write_file(file_path="/final_report.html", content="<complete HTML>")
```

Supported style presets (from STYLE_PRESETS.md): Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Creative Voltage, Dark Botanical, Notebook Tabs, Pastel Geometry, Split Pastel, Vintage Editorial, Neon Cyber, Terminal Green, Swiss Modern, Paper & Ink.

## Phase 4: PPT Conversion

When converting PowerPoint files:

1. **Extract content** — Run `python scripts/extract-pptx.py <input.pptx> <output_dir>` (install python-pptx if needed: `pip install python-pptx`)
2. **Confirm with user** — Present extracted slide titles, content summaries, and image counts
3. **Style selection** — Proceed to Phase 2 for style discovery
4. **Generate HTML** — Convert to chosen style, preserving all text, images (from assets/), slide order, and speaker notes (as HTML comments). Save with `write_file`.

---

## Phase 5: Delivery

1. **Clean up** — Delete `.claude-design/slide-previews/` if it exists
2. **Open** — Use `open [filename].html` to launch in browser
3. **Summarize** — Tell the user:
   - File location, style name, slide count
   - Navigation: Arrow keys, Space, scroll/swipe, click nav dots
   - How to customize: `:root` CSS variables for colors, font link for typography, `.reveal` class for animations
   - If inline editing was enabled: Hover top-left corner or press E to enter edit mode, click any text to edit, Ctrl+S to save

---

## Phase 6: Share & Export (Optional)

After delivery, **ask the user:** _"Would you like to share this presentation? I can deploy it to a live URL (works on any device including phones) or export it as a PDF."_

Options:

- **Deploy to URL** — Shareable link that works on any device
- **Export to PDF** — Universal file for email, Slack, print
- **Both**
- **No thanks**

If the user declines, stop here. If they choose one or both, proceed below.

### 6A: Deploy to a Live URL (Vercel)

This deploys the presentation to Vercel — a free hosting platform. The link works on any device (phones, tablets, laptops) and stays live until the user takes it down.

**If the user has never deployed before, guide them step by step:**

1. **Check if Vercel CLI is installed** — Run `npx vercel --version`. If not found, install Node.js first.

2. **Check if user is logged in** — Run `npx vercel whoami`.
   - If NOT logged in, explain: _"Vercel is a free hosting service. You need an account to deploy."_
   - Guide them through signup at https://vercel.com/signup and `vercel login`
   - Wait for the user to confirm they're logged in before proceeding.

3. **Deploy** — Run the deploy script (from this skill's scripts/ directory):

   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy.sh <path-to-presentation>
   ```

   The script accepts either a folder (with index.html) or a single HTML file.

4. **Share the URL** — Tell the user it works on any device and how to take it down later.

**⚠ Deployment gotchas:**
- The deploy script auto-detects images referenced via `src="..."`. CSS `background-image` may be missed.
- Prefer folder deployments when the presentation has many assets.
- Filenames with spaces work but can cause issues — use hyphens instead.

### 6B: Export to PDF

This captures each slide as a screenshot and combines them into a PDF.

**Note:** Animations and interactivity are not preserved — the PDF is a static snapshot.

1. **Run the export script:**

   ```bash
   bash scripts/export-pdf.sh <path-to-html> [output.pdf]
   ```

   If no output path is given, the PDF is saved next to the HTML file.

2. **What happens:** A headless browser opens the presentation at 1920×1080, screenshots each slide, and combines them into a PDF. The script needs Playwright — it will install automatically if missing.

3. **If Playwright installation fails:** The most common issue is Chromium not downloading. Run: `npx playwright install chromium`.

4. **Deliver the PDF** — The script auto-opens it. Tell the user the file location, size, and that animations are replaced by their final visual state.

**⚠ PDF export gotchas:**
- Wait for the export to complete before opening — large presentations take longer.
- The PDF is created in the same directory as the HTML file by default.
- Export works best with Chrome/Chromium installed. If Playwright can't find a browser, install Chromium manually.
